# Version Control Presentation
I'm giving a presentation on 2012-02-23 on what I consider best practices
for version control in source configuration management.

It's a sort of manifesto, really.

I'm putting together the presentation using Pandoc, which I can run from my
netbook but not from my work computer, so I'm using GitHub to keep files
in a common location.

Nothing I say in this talk is specific to my company, and it may be of
general interest, so GitHub is as good a place to keep it as any.
